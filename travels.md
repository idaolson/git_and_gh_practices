My favorite travel experience was when I walked the Camino de Santiago
in Spain with my friend Kat. We walked 550 miles from the French border
across northern Spain. It took us 38 days and I had blisters on top
of blisters, but it was worth it. I made some incredible friends
along the way, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things.
