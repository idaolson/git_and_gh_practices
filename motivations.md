I quit my job on Friday and I've decided to pursue a new career in
tech because I'm not happy with the changes I've experienced in
education in the past 17 years. I was beginning to feel a bit like
the frog who stayed too long until the water was boiling. I want to
pursue something that challenges me instead of staying in my safe job
until I retire or die. I want to use parts of my brain that have
felt dormant for a while. I want to struggle and learn.
